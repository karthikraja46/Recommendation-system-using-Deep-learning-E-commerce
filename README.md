**With their ability to forecast preferences based on vast user histories, recommendation systems are essential to current services. Using the Amazon reviews dataset, this study examines the efficacy of classical machine learning (ML) models, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in e-commerce suggestions. Sophisticated methods like collaborative filtering are investigated to improve suggestion precision. We evaluate these models' performance and compare their accuracies through extensive testing to determine which model is best for forecasting user behavior and enhancing the quality of recommendations. Comprehensive research and significant insights into the efficacy of recommendation systems are made possible by utilizing the extensive user input and preferences included in the Amazon reviews dataset. Our results aid in the e-commerce industry's recommendation system optimization by providing helpful advice on which. **

**The model includes input layers for item data and category labels. Item data is reshaped to fit an LSTM layer, which predicts sequence patterns. Following LSTM, some information is discarded to prevent overfitting, while labels are flattened. These sets are combined and reshaped for category prediction. Training optimizes internal settings using RMSprop, with batches of 64 size and validation data for performance evaluation. Post-training, the model achieved 59% accuracy in categorization for both seen and unseen data.**![image](https://github.com/karthikraja46/Recommendation-system-using-Deep-learning-E-commerce/assets/96817647/a92f0111-56a9-49c1-804c-d793b2a4e48b)
